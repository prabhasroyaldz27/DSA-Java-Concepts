Inbuilt Sort in Java

To sort an array, Java provides the method:
Arrays.sort(arrayName);
This method is available in the java.util.Arrays package, or you can directly import java.util.*.

Time Complexity: O(n log n)

If you want to sort up to a particular position or between specific indices, you can use:
Arrays.sort(arrayName, si, ei);

si → starting index (inclusive)

ei → ending index (exclusive)

If you want to sort an array in reverse order, you can use:
Arrays.sort(arrayName, Collections.reverseOrder());
⚠️ This will only work with non‑primitive data types (like objects), not primitive arrays.
